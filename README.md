# Garage (S&Box)

My little "game" based on [Simple Weapon Base](https://github.com/timmybo5/simple-weapon-base).
You can [play Garage on S&Box](https://asset.party/looobsoft/garage).

## Cool feature
* Now you have only 2 weapons in-game (YAY!!!!)

## What change from the original version ?
There are no radical changes but I fixed a few problems:
* You can now leave the chat box when you use Right Click (secondary attack)
